# EWTS (Extended Wylie Transliteration Scheme) Javascript Library 

Converts between ETWS and Unicode. This is a port to Javascript from Java of the [buda-base/ewts-converter](https://github.com/buda-base/ewts-converter) project. 
Which was itself a copy of the equivalent Perl module, Lingua::BO::Converter.

The port from Java to Javascript was created using [JSweet](http://www.jsweet.org/).
